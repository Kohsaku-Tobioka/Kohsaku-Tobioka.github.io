Hi, welcome to my webpage. I am a researcher of particle physics as known as high energy physics. I mainly work on the theoretical aspects of physics beyond the Standard Model. 

Big picture 
------
Despite the established frameworks provided by the Standard Model of particle physics for fundamental forces and matter, and the Lambda CDM model for cosmic evolution, overwhelming observational evidence suggests we must develop theories beyond these models. Physics in the particle world is deeply connected to the mysteries of teh universe, and finding new physics is crucial for understanding our universe!  
As a researcher specializing in particle physics, I  focus on theoretical aspects of physics beyond the Standard Model while looking for the hints through various cutting-edge experiments; from underground to outerspace, from the extremeley precise machines to the gigantic colliders.
 

I regularly give outreach lectures at my university through [Saturday Morning Physics](https://physics.fsu.edu/saturday-morning-physics) and also am open to speaking at local schools.

Research Interests
======
1. Physics Beyond the Standard Model
2. Phenomenology of particle physics and cosmology
