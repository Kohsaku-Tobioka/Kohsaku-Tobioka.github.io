Hi, I am [Your Name], and I am passionate about uncovering the mysteries of our universe. Despite the established frameworks provided by the Standard Model of particle physics for fundamental forces and matter, and the Lambda CDM model for cosmic evolution, observational evidence suggests we must explore beyond these models. As a researcher specializing in particle physics, or high-energy physics, I primarily focus on theoretical aspects of physics beyond the Standard Model while collaborating closely with various cutting-edge experiments.

I invite you to explore my research, delve into my publications, and join me on this fascinating journey at the forefront of theoretical physics, where each day brings us closer to unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos. I also give outreach lectures at the university and am open to speaking at local schools.

Research Interests
