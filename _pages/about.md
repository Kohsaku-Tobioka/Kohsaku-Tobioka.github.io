Hi, welcome to my webpage. I go by Tobi, nickname from the last name. 

I am passionate about exploring the mysteries of our universe. Despite the established frameworks provided by the Standard Model of particle physics for fundamental forces and matter, and the Lambda CDM model for cosmic evolution, overwhelming observational evidence suggests we must develop theories beyond these models. As a researcher specializing in particle physics, as known as high-energy physics, I  focus on theoretical aspects of physics beyond the Standard Model while looking for the hints through various cutting-edge experiments; from underground to outerspace, from the extremeley precise machines to the gigantic colliders.

I invite you to explore my research and join me on this fascinating journey at the forefront of theoretical physics, where each day brings us closer to unraveling the mysteries of the quantum cosmos. 

I regularly give outreach lectures at my university through [Saturday Morning Physics](https://physics.fsu.edu/saturday-morning-physics) and also am open to speaking at local schools.
