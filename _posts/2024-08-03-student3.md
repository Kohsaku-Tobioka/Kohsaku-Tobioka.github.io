Are you interested in undergraduate research in High Energy Physics (HEP) theory? While this field demands a strong foundation in mathematics and physics, itâ€™s exciting to tackle the challenge.

To be considered, you should have A-level grades in your physics and math coursework. You must know quantum mechanics and relativity. Although conducting original research in this field is STILL difficult, there may be opportunities for you to contribute to smaller projects or aspects of larger research efforts, depending on your skills and background.

If you meet these criteria, please arrange a meeting with me to discuss potential research opportunities.
