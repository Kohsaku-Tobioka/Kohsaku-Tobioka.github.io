Thank you for your interest in our graduate program and my research. 
The most important thing is: Please apply to our graduate program through the department. If you plan to visit FSU, please contact me to arrange a chat.  

The HEP theory group is always looking for a motivated student! We mentor and work together across the different professors. I closely work with Prof. Okui to co-supervise graduate students. Note that my research is theroretical particle physics with focus on physics beyond the standard model including astroparticle physics and cosmology, but NOT string theory nor (quantum) gravity.  You can look at my recent papers in   [inspires](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1198400)

The advisor is not assigned at the time of admission. To be a HEP theory student, youâ€™re expected to pass the qualification exam upon the admission (you have four chances), and show good performance in the coursework. Besides these, you need to learn the quantum field theory, so I encourage you to study it for example read Peskin&Schroeder or Weinberg.
