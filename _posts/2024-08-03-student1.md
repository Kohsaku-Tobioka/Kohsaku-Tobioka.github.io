Thank you for your interest in our graduate program and my research. The first step is to apply to our graduate program through the department. If you plan to visit FSU, please contact me to arrange a meeting.

The High Energy Physics (HEP) theory group is always looking for motivated students! Our group fosters a collaborative environment where students are mentored by different professors. I work closely with Prof. Okui to co-supervise graduate students.

My research focuses on theoretical particle physics, particularly on physics beyond the standard model, including astroparticle physics and cosmology. Please note that I do not work in string theory or (quantum) gravity. You can view my recent papers on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1198400)
.

Advisors are not assigned at the time of admission. To become a HEP theory student, you are expected to pass the qualification exam upon admission (you have four attempts) and demonstrate good performance in your coursework. Additionally, you need to learn quantum field theory. I recommend studying the subject, for example, textbooks by  Peskin & Schroeder or Weinberg.
