I gave an outreach lecture in FSU's [Saturday Morning Physics](https://physics.fsu.edu/saturday-morning-physics), "Smashing Atoms to Size Up the Universe" with Prof. Daniel Pershey. This year, we had two activities that many small children have engaged. Looking forward to seeing you in 2025. If you want to have this kind of lecture at a local school, please contact me.
