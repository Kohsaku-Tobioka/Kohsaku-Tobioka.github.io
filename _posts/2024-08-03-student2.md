Thank you for your interest in my research! If you're considering joining my group, the best way to reach out is by contacting me directly or stopping by my officeâ€”my door is usually open. You can view my recent papers on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1198400)

Here are some general expectations for prospective group members:

* Qualifications: You are expected to pass the qualification exam for all subjects and either be taking or have completed graduate core courses.
* Preferred Knowledge: While studying quantum field theory is highly beneficial, it is not a mandatory requirement.
* Curiosity: The most important trait in our field is curiosity. Passion and eagerness to explore new ideas are essential.

If you contact me during your first year (preferably at the beginning of the spring semester), I will guide you to read some research papers or textbooks that align with your interests. You are also encouraged to bring your own interests and projects to the table.

I work closely with Prof. Okui to co-supervise graduate students, which is a significant benefit for you. Additionally, I collaborate with theorists and experimentalists outside of FSU, providing opportunities for you to join these collaborations.
