I gave "Have you ever seen Avocado moving to Colorado?" and GPT4 took over. 


*Have you ever seen Avocado moving to Colorado?*

*Did you ever spot a Tomato, Dancing in Chicago?* 

*Or perhaps a Potato, Skating in Ontario?*

*Have you seen a Mango, Playing bingo in Santiago?* 

*Or caught a flamingo, Doing tango in San Francisco?*

*Ever noticed a Burrito, Reading Plato in Puerto Rico?* 

*Or a mosquito, Playing cello in Montevideo?*

*Yes, these sights are quite odd, though,* 

*Like an Avocado, Off to Colorado!"*
