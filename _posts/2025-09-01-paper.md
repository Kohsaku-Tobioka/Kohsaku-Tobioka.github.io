Neutrino properties from muonium-antimuonium mixing
M. Ghosh, K. Liguori, T. Okui, K. Tobioka

In this paper, we calculate the neutrino mass effect to muonium-antimuonium conversion process to address one of the central open questions in particle physics: are neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac fermions?
