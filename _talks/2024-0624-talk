While the Higgs measurements at the LHC exhibit excellent agreement with the Standard Model, the exploration of the Higgs potential, such as the cubic coupling, remains limited. Currently, the di-Higgs production measurement serves as a reasonable probe, but it will be still challenging even at the HL-LHC. Therefore, additional observables would greatly enhance our understanding of the Higgs sector.

In my talk, I will discuss the potential of vector boson fusion (VBF) processes at high energies, such as VV->hhh and VVh. These processes are expected to increase with collision energy if there are modifications in the Higgs sector. The Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) offers comprehensive guidance for identifying these processes. I will particularly emphasize the importance of VBF processes involving fewer Higgs bosons in the final state. These VBF probes become more powerful at higher energies, making them especially intriguing in the context of a muon collider.
